# Finance manager
Get an overview of your net worth by tracking all your equities, across brokers, in one simple interface.

I've built this as a side project to learn react, javascript, eslint, prettier, node, postgress and heroku web deployment.

## Getting started
In the project directory, run:

- `npm install` to install all dependencies
- `npm start` to start the finance manager at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Note that this project requires the [Finance Server](https://github.com/JeroenMols/finance-server) in order to work.

> Tip: to test out the functionality without manually entering all your equities, import the following CSV: `VOO,6,IWDA.AS,30,MSFT,3,AAPL,5,TSLA,4,GOOG,7,NVDA,6,AMZN,7`
